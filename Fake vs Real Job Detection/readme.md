# **Fake vs Real Job Detection Using Machine Learning**  

### **Overview**  
This project aims to classify job postings as real or fraudulent using machine learning techniques. With the rise of online job portals, fraudulent job postings have become a significant concern. This project builds a predictive model to help identify fake job listings based on key features extracted from job descriptions.  

### **Dataset**  
The dataset used in this project contains job postings with various attributes, including job title, location, company profile, description, requirements, and whether the posting was flagged as fraudulent.  

üìå **Dataset Source**: [Fake Job Postings Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction)

### **Installation & Setup**  
To run this notebook, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.  

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn wordcloud spacy matplotlib
```

Clone this repository and navigate to the project folder:  

```bash

### **Approach**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Combined text-based columns into a single `text` column.  
   - Removed unnecessary columns to simplify the dataset.  
   - Handled missing values.  

2. **Feature Engineering & Vectorization**  
   - Converted textual data into numerical format using TF-IDF.  

3. **Model Building & Evaluation**  
   - Implemented **Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest** models.  
   - Compared models using accuracy and other evaluation metrics.  
   - Identified the best-performing model based on classification reports and confusion matrices.  

4. **Visualization & Insights**  
   - Generated **WordClouds** for fraudulent and real job postings.  
   - Created **Confusion Matrices** to analyze misclassifications.  

### **Results & Findings**  
üèÜ **Best Performing Model**: Random Forest with an accuracy of '0.98'.  
üìä **Confusion Matrix & Classification Report** highlight key insights into the model‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses.  

### **Next Steps**  
‚úÖ Improve feature selection with **advanced NLP techniques** (word embeddings, sentiment analysis).   
‚úÖ **Hyperparameter tuning** to optimize model performance.  
‚úÖ Deploy the model as an API or web-based application for real-world use.
