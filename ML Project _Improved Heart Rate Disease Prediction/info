The focus of this project is to develop prediction algorithm using machine learning that could help in predicting heart diseases and other heart related ailments in humans.
The machine learning technique used in the paper focus on ‘Stacked Ensemble’ Technique. 
This machine learning project focuses on implementing an already published paper available at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.06015.pdf
To further improve the algorithm, following methods have been implemented:
  1. Use feature selection to focus on attributes that contribute more to the target variable decision.
  2. Evaluate all the base models and use only the ones that have better result for the target variable compared to others.
  3. Use 2-level stacking
